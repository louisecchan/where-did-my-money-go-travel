# Travel Bookings Tracker for Gmail (Agoda

A Google Apps Script that pulls your Agoda booking details from Gmail and saves them into a Google Sheet. It helps you keep track of your travel spending automatically.

## How It Works

1. Searches Gmail for Agoda booking confirmations.
2. Extracts details like hotel name, dates, price, and location.
3. Adds the data to a connected Google Sheet.

2. Copy-paste the code from [`code.gs`](https://github.com/louisecchan/where-did-my-money-go-travel/blob/main/code.gs).
3. Create a new Google Sheet to hold your data.
